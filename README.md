# Mortal Wombat: the Roguelike

Trying my hand at building a roguelike with `rltk`, the roguelike toolkit.

Right now it's just a simple window that says `MORTAL WOMBAT MFERS`.

```
$ git clone https://tildegit.org/mortalwombat/mw-rl.git
...
$ cd mw-rl
$ cargo build --release
$ ./target/release/mw-rl
...
```
